Pre-work required

The repo mlopsclassactivity2 (already provided).
Ensure each student/pair has a fork or cloned copy with push access (or via their own GitHub).
Quick review of the repo structure: train.py, app.py, Dockerfile.train, Dockerfile.serve, preprocess.py, requirements.txt, etc.
If needed: an existing Docker registry (DockerHub or similar) credentials for container push steps (can be simplified or mocked if network/time is short).


Activity Steps:
1. Fork the provided repository: mlops-ci-activity.
2. Explore the repository structure (preprocess.py, train.py, evaluate.py, requirements.txt).
3. Review the workflow file located at .github/workflows/ci-pipeline.yml.
4. Trigger the workflow by making a small change (e.g., edit README.md) and pushing to main.
5. Observe the workflow execution in the GitHub Actions tab.
6. Download the trained model artifact from the Actions run results.

Discussion Questions:
1 How does CI/CD improve collaboration in ML teams?
- It ensures that all team members work on the same code and data, automatically tests training and evaluation, and catches errors early, so models and pipelines remain consistent.

2 What happens if the evaluation score is below a defined threshold?
- The quality gate (or evaluator, depending on implementation) will throw an error which causes workflow execution to stop with a flag / exit status code

3 How can retraining or drift detection be integrated into this workflow?
 -Add steps to check data and model drift; if drift is detected or metrics drop, automatically trigger retraining within the pipeline.

4 What steps are needed to deploy this workflow to production (e.g., AWS, Kubernetes)?
 -Package the model in a container or TFX pipeline, push to a registry, and deploy using a cloud service (AWS, GCP) or Kubernetes. Automate deployment with CI/CD tools like Jenkins.
