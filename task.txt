Pre-work required

The repo mlopsclassactivity2 (already provided).
Ensure each student/pair has a fork or cloned copy with push access (or via their own GitHub).
Quick review of the repo structure: train.py, app.py, Dockerfile.train, Dockerfile.serve, preprocess.py, requirements.txt, etc.
If needed: an existing Docker registry (DockerHub or similar) credentials for container push steps (can be simplified or mocked if network/time is short).


Activity Steps:
1. Fork the provided repository: mlops-ci-activity.
2. Explore the repository structure (preprocess.py, train.py, evaluate.py, requirements.txt).
3. Review the workflow file located at .github/workflows/ci-pipeline.yml.
4. Trigger the workflow by making a small change (e.g., edit README.md) and pushing to main.
5. Observe the workflow execution in the GitHub Actions tab.
6. Download the trained model artifact from the Actions run results.
Discussion Questions

How does CI/CD improve collaboration in ML teams?
By establishing a single, automated process for testing code, data, and models, CI/CD ensures consistency and reproducibility. It facilitates collaboration by identifying integration issues and model regressions early in the development lifecycle.

What happens if the evaluation score is below a defined threshold?
A Quality Gate is triggered within the pipeline. If the evaluation metric fails to meet the minimum required threshold, the pipeline will fail the build (exit with a non-zero status code), preventing the underperforming model from being registered or promoted for deployment.

How can retraining or drift detection be integrated into this workflow?
Integration is achieved by adding a monitoring service that tracks model and data performance in production. If this service detects data drift or concept drift, it triggers the CI/CD pipeline to execute an automated retraining workflow.

What steps are needed to deploy this workflow to production (e.g., AWS, Kubernetes)?
The essential steps are containerization of the inference service (using Docker), pushing the image to a container registry (e.g., ECR or DockerHub), and then triggering a Continuous Deployment (CD) job. This job uses an orchestration platform (like Kubernetes or a cloud-native service) to serve the model.
